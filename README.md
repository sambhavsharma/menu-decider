# menu-decider
Weekly menu decider for my household!

Now my wife and I don't bug eachother anymore with "What do you want to eat today?" and asking each other to decide. No more confusion!

Easy to add/remove dishes, healthy/unhealthy dishes count etc. Let me know if there are any suggestions or improvements. :) 

This saves your weekly menu in this_weeks_menu.txt file.

To run:

$ ruby menu.rb

Next Steps:
* Add WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger Integrations!
* Add Email Integrations.
* Add command line params for whatever possible.
